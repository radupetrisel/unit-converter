<h1>UnitConverter</h1>

This is the first challenge app of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19)).

This challenge is about creating an app that allows users to convert between different kinds of units (<i>meters</i> to <i>feet</i>, <i>liters</i> to <i>ounces</i> or <i>gallons<i>, etc.).

The app itself is a "challenge" (as they are named in the course), so there will be no extra challenges added at the end today.
